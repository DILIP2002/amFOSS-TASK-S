ABOUT
i am very intrested in  makeing some thing crazy stuff in software. i like software development very much because when i am was 7th there  are small phones are 
are been used only for calling and playing small games and  day by day are the things are changen like some days back people thought that iphone fingerprint sensor 
is really advanced model which is major profit for iphone they thought now iphone had updated to face like its is a small example i am saying all the people like to 
update with new things and they will forgot about old thing.By seeing that new software updates i used to see bug are cleared so that i had started to google it and 
tried to learn and i had learned some stuff.so in that time onwards i had decided to become a software developer  and full fill my dream to creat a software or
app. so that is reason i had joined in amrita and choosed AMfoss.                                                                     .
